# 🕵️ Machine Learning-Based Crime Hotspot Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze crime data and identify high-risk spatial and temporal hotspots.

## 📌 Overview
We analyzed more than **980,000 crime records** using Python and ML models to uncover patterns in crime occurrence.  
The model pipeline was automated with Apache Airflow for scheduled retraining and integrated with BigQuery for scalability.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (scikit-learn, Pandas)** for data preprocessing and modeling  
- **ML Models:** Random Forest, KNN, SVM  
- **Apache Airflow** for pipeline scheduling  
- **Google BigQuery** for large-scale querying and storage

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **87% accuracy** and an **F1-score of 0.84**  
- Reduced false positives by 12% compared to the baseline  
- Automated retraining and reporting for continuous monitoring

## 🚀 What’s Included
- Data cleaning and EDA scripts (coming soon)  
- ML model training notebooks  
- Pipeline design documentation
